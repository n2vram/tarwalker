tarwalker
=========

*TarWalker* provides a method to easily scan files somewhat like
`os.walk <https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.walk>`_,
handling compressed files, recursing through directories and scanning
within `tarfiles <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)>`_.

The library is very stable, changes are rare. It well documented and
has full unit testing (100% code coverage), and is maintained.
